## About
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Physics](https://www.mpp.mpg.de/en/) in Munich. Before coming to Munich, I was a postdoc at [The University of Amsterdam](https://iop.uva.nl/itfa/themes/particlephysics/particlephysics.html) (though I spent most of my time at [Nikhef](https://theory.web.nikhef.nl/)) from 2017-2020. I obtained my PhD in 2017 from [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/physics/) where I was a member of the [Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/).

## Research

Most of my research has revolved around the theme of "Effective Field Theories". This powerful framework can be used not only to make accurate predictions for particle physics expierments (notably The LHC), but also explore how (heavy) physics beyond the Standard Model might manifest itself at the energy regiemes probed by our current experiments.

A large focus of my work has revolved around the so-called Standard Model Effective Theory (SMEFT). Taking the SM seriously as an EFT, this framework includes new features (higher mass dimension operators / non-renormalizable terms) in the SM which could appear from new physics which is just beyond the reach of our current experiments. Here I worked on calculating the impact the (naively most relevant) effects might have on decays of heavy bosons, most notably the Higgs boson.

Beside SMEFT, my research also touched a number of different areas including working on calculations of increased accuracy for processes at the Large Hadron Collide, predominantly for top-quark pair production.

I didn't want to clog the homepage with too much detail on this, but for those who want more specific details I've written more in the [Research](/research.md) section. Hopefully still in an accessible style.
