## About
I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Physics](https://www.mpp.mpg.de/en/) in Munich. Before coming to Munich, I was a postdoc at [The University of Amsterdam](https://iop.uva.nl/itfa/themes/particlephysics/particlephysics.html) (though I spent most of my time at [Nikhef](https://theory.web.nikhef.nl/)) from 2017-2020. I obtained my PhD in 2017 from [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/physics/) where I was a member of the [Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/).

## Research
Most of my in fundamental physics has revolved around trying to understand how "new physics" might perturb the Standard Model and the predictions we might obtain from there might be altered. A (somewhat) model independent framework for performing such calculations is known as the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), which I worked with extensively and studied the decays of heavy bosons; most notably the Higgs.

Beside SMEFT, my research also touched a number of different areas including working on calculations of increased accuracy for processes at the Large Hadron Collide, predominantly for top-quark pair production (this was actually the first area I started working in during my PhD).

I give more details about my research in the [Research](/research.md) section of my site. Hopefully written in an accessible style.
