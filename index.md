## About
<img src="/assets/images/banners/me_250x250.png" align="right" width="250px"/>

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for Physics](https://www.mpp.mpg.de/en/){:target="_blank"} in Munich. Before coming to Munich, I was a postdoc at [The University of Amsterdam](https://iop.uva.nl/itfa/themes/particlephysics/particlephysics.html){:target="_blank"} (though I spent most of my time at [Nikhef](https://theory.web.nikhef.nl/){:target="_blank"}) from 2017-2020. I obtained my PhD in 2017 from [Durham University](https://www.durham.ac.uk/departments/academic/physics/){:target="_blank"} where I was a member of the [Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}.

I intend to upload some notes which I have written (or half written) during my time in physics. They mostly concern specific calculations/conepts/problems which I either found difficult or had to work out as I went along. Who knows, maybe making them available here might be helpful to someone else too.

## Research

*<font size="3" color="GoldenRod">This is currently written assuming a little background in at least the basic concepts of quantum field theory on behalf of the reader. I may add more accessible descriptions in the future. </font>*

Most of my research has revolved around the theme of "Effective Field Theories" (EFTs). This powerful framework can be used not only to make accurate predictions for particle physics experiments, but also explore how (heavy) physics beyond the Standard Model might manifest itself at the energy regimes probed by our current experiments, even if we can't produce the particles directly.

In particular, a particular focus of mine has been on the so-called Standard Model Effective Theory (SMEFT). Taking the Standard Model (SM) seriously as an EFT, this framework includes new features in the SM (higher mass dimension operators / non-renormalizable terms) which could result from new physics which is just beyond the reach of our current experiments. One of my larger projects involved calculating the effects the first set of these new effects might have on the decay of heavy bosons (most notably the Higgs), and doing so to a high accuracy.

Beside SMEFT, my research also touched a number of different areas including working on calculations of increased accuracy for standard processes at the Large Hadron Collider, predominantly for top-quark pair production, but also for processes involving new, undiscovered particles.

I didn't want to clog the homepage with too much detail on this, but for those who want more specific details I've written more in the [Research](/research.md) section.

For anyone *really* interested, a full list of my papers can be found [here](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1470872){:target="_blank"}.
