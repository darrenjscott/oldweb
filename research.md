## Effective Field Theories
UNDER CONSTRUCTION
<!-- My research has mostly focussed on making predictions relevant for physics around the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Throughout my research I have worked within the framework of Effective Field Theory (EFT). Specifically:
- *Soft Collinear Effective Theory* (SCET)
- *Standard Model Effective Field Theory* (SMEFT)

While there are many EFTs which have been developed to address different situations, these two actually provide a useful comparison between two categories of EFT; namely "top down" and "bottom up". Top down EFTs are typically derived from a theory we know by removing degrees of freedom, expanding the theory as a Taylor series (power expansion) around some limits we are interested in. As such, we can focus only on the dynamics we are interested in looking at in a given calculation, and moreover we can, in principle, derive the form our EFT should take to any given order in the power expansion we like.

SCET is an example of a top down theory. -->


## Specific topics
### Resummation for top-quark pair production
Making predictions for the production of top quarks at hadron colliders is complicated by the fact that the top quark itself is a pretty massive particle. In fact, it is the heaviest fundamental particle we know of. Often, if we're making predictions involving other fermions, we can simply ignore the fact they have mass knowing any effect it has will be limited to corrections which are (hopefully) small compared to our prediction. We can almost never do this with top quarks.

### Effects of new physics in Higgs decays
