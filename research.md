My research has mostly focussed on making predictions relevant for physics around the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Throughout my research I have worked within the framework of Effective Field Theory (EFT). Specifically:
- *Soft Collinear Effective Theory* (SCET)
- *Standard Model Effective Field Theory* (SMEFT)

# Effective Field Theory
EFTs are theories we can use which by construction, focus necessarily on the relevant physics at one specific resolution. They therefore necessarily discard lots of interesting physics and phenomena, in favour of the dynamics in one particular setting. It might be natural then to ask what the point of such theories is, given that we have seemingly better and "more complete" theories to work with. But the fact that they discard so much..

# Standard Model Effective Field Theory
## What?
Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) is
