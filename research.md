#### Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT)
The SMEFT augments the usual Lagrangian of the Standard Model with higher mass-dimension (non-renormalizable) operators. The idea being that a large class of new physics models which involve heavy new physics, might give rise to these operators in the SM Lagrangian, once the heavy particles are integrated out. The high scale associated with the new physics is then captured in the Wilson coefficients of this (infinite) set of new operators. These operators are naturally ordered by their mass dimension since the Wilson coefficient associated to each operator is suppressed by inverse powers of the energy scale associated to the operator. Thus, if new physics lives at a scale of 1TeV, we might reasonably decide to start exploring operators which scale only as, say $(1 {\rm TeV})^{-2}$ as compared to those which scale as $(1 {\rm TeV})^{-4}$.

We calculated the effects this operators might have on the decays of heavy bosons (most notably the Higgs) up to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy. Taking the most agnostic approach, making minimal assumptions we include the effects of any and all operators which could contribute to the decay process of the Higgs.
