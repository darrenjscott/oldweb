Our current understanding of the fundamental nature of reality is embodied in *The Standard Model of Particle Physics*. I should be fair to my friends and colleagues who work on in areas concerned with general relativity (GR) and cosmology, since GR is currently our best experimentally verified description of gravity, while The Standard Model of Cosmology (&Lambda;CDM) details the evolution of the universe as a whole. But my game is with The Standard Model (SM)...

The SM provides a description of matter at the most fundamental level that we can currently experimentally verify. It describes what matter-like particles seem to exist and three of the four fundamental forces we know of (electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces) that influence how this matter interacts. It is a reasonably tight-knit theory, held in place by underlying symmetries. These heavily determine what kind of form the equations which define the theory can take, and ultimately what kind of interactions are allowed and which aren't! There is actually a lot of interesting stuff to say about the structure of the theory, buty I'll save that for another section.

An excellent testing ground for the SM, is in a particle collider. Probably the most famous of these at the moment is the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at [CERN](https://home.cern/]).

The Standard Model (SM) is, and I think most physicists agree, annoyingly successful.


Dropped from the reasearch section
<!-- My research has mostly focussed on making predictions relevant for physics around the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Throughout my research I have worked within the framework of Effective Field Theory (EFT). Specifically:
- *Soft Collinear Effective Theory* (SCET)
- *Standard Model Effective Field Theory* (SMEFT)

While there are many EFTs which have been developed to address different situations, these two actually provide a useful comparison between two categories of EFT; namely "top down" and "bottom up". Top down EFTs are typically derived from a theory we know by removing degrees of freedom, expanding the theory as a Taylor series (power expansion) around some limits we are interested in. As such, we can focus only on the dynamics we are interested in looking at in a given calculation, and moreover we can, in principle, derive the form our EFT should take to any given order in the power expansion we like.

SCET is an example of a top down theory. -->

Making predictions for the production of top quarks at hadron colliders is complicated by the fact that the top quark itself is a pretty massive particle. In fact, it is the heaviest fundamental particle we know of. Often, if we're making predictions involving other fermions, we can simply ignore the fact they have mass knowing any effect it has will be limited to corrections which are (hopefully) small compared to our prediction. We can almost never do this with top quarks.
